	For at Home Financial Application
=======================================

Goals: To help automate financials, help save money

Needs:
	1. Fincial Record (Database) - mysql or google drive. Google Drive as primary/ mysql as backup.
	2. Access to financial records - Scraping banks is difficult, download csv of transactions is easier to work with
	3. Docker Container so its easy to transport
	4. Machine Learning algorithm to label transactions (MLA)

Concept:
	Financial transactions can be sub divided into categories for the month (Food, Dates, Gas, etc). MLA will label these and subtract them 
	from the alloted amount. Over time analysis of this process will lead to estimation on how much you need and where you can save.

To Do:
	Google Drive API accessible database
	MLA - Python
	Dockerfile
